# 👋 Hi, I'm Sky

I'm just starting my journey into coding — figuring things out one bug at a time.  
Right now, I'm focused on learning the basics and building small projects to get hands-on experience.

---

### 💻 What I'm Learning
- 🌐 HTML + CSS – building web pages that *mostly* behave
- 🔣 C Programming – understanding how things really work under the hood
- 🧠 How to think like a developer (and how to Google like a ninja)
- 🛠️ Git & GitHub – version control and collaboration basics

---

### 🎯 Goals for 2025
- 🚀 Launch my first personal website
- 🔧 Build a project I’m actually proud of
- 👨‍💻 Start learning JavaScript and make my sites interactive
- 🤝 Contribute to an open-source project (even a tiny fix counts!)

---

### 📌 Current Status
> No idea what I’m doing yet, but I’m loving the chaos.

Thanks for stopping by. Stick around—cool stuff is on the way. ☁️
